I had only worked on personal projects up until that point, and I wasnâ€™t familiar with how real time work happens in industry. Not only technically but this program helped to me gain organizational , time Management, communication and team collaboration skills. I would like to end this  by saying that my data analytics externship has been an incredible journey. I got the opportunity to work with a team of talented and driven individuals, who guided me every step of the way. Thank You Trainity! &rdquo;
