                          all projects in the experience, you will get a full
                          refund at the end of the program. We have a 100% refund
                          approval rate, which means 100% of our students who

                          The projects are not pass/fail, that is if you attempt

                          Unlike other companies, we don’t charge anything to get
                          an extension. It’s just that you will not be eligible
                          for a refund if you don’t complete it within the given
                          duration.

                          Internships have proved to boost placement and job
                          opportunities for any candidate by 5-7x. Students who
                          have internship experience are easily noticed by
                          recruiters and are always given preference for
                          interviews. However, getting an internship experience is
                          extremely hard if you follow the standard route of
                          applying via portals like internshala/linkedin, your
                          chances of getting an internship is less than 5% . This
                          is the same reason, the majority of students have blank
                          and empty resumes by the time they reach their final
                          year and sit for placements and are unable to get campus
                          placements while students having experience are the ones
                          who get placed at campus placements. Here, we step in to
