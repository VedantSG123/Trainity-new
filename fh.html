      <div class="answer:">
 Internships have proved to boost placement and job opportunities for any candidate by 5-7x. Students who have internship experience are easily noticed by recruiters and are always given preference for interviews. However, getting an internship experience is extremely hard if you follow the standard route of applying via portals like internshala/linkedin, your chances of getting an internship is less than 5% . This is the same reason, the majority of students have blank and empty resumes by the time they reach their final year and sit for placements and are unable to get campus placements while students having experience are the ones who get placed at campus placements. Here, we step in to provide you with valid and official Internship experience so you can break out of no experience no job cycle.</div>
